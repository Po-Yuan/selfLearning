there are two ways to change origin data to data sctrue.
1.change point
2.change the sort of the data in physically

what is data struceture?
the data structure is relationship between datas 
example:two-binary tree or two-binary search tree or two-binary heap tree or delete n times

why data structure is important?
data structure could afford us more strategy to use the data


what is algorithm?
the strategy of using data(view/search/dynamic programing)
example: pre-order traversal(quick sort) or post-order traversal(merge sort) or in-order traversal(tree sort) or search(binaryu search) or delete(heap sort)
