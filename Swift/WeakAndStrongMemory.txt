It is important concept in swift. there is the apple explanation:
IF there is no strong memory point to weak memory, it will be deleted or go away

target: avoid out of memory

weak var str = "weakmemory"
weak var str : String = "weakmemory"

all variable deafult type is strong memory

e.g.

class Child{
	weak var balloon="str"
}

var joe = Child()

without Joe, every thing is weak.
